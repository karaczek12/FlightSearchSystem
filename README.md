Flight Search System

For this project I used Model View Controller as design pattern.

I used Java, Spring, JPA, Thymleaf, Bootstrap and HTML to create this project.

Java as programming language, JPA to manage relational data, Thymeleaf as a template engine, Bootstrap as css framework and Spring as a framework to build web based application.

To use this project please create schema in mySQL called flight_search_system, run the project once and add available flighs in database.
